      <p>Welcome to page! My name is Imran Hamayon Hussain and Im attending a 6 month Web Development coding bootcamp at University of Texas at Austin's. I'm also a photographer and filmmaker, I like taking pictures of landscapes, exotic birds and anything that catches my attention.</p>

      <p>I love reading books on self improvement, some of my favorite books are the 10x Rule, how to win friends influence people, Winners Effect, New Earth and the list keeps going on. I also love working out and doing cardio so I do my best to go to the gym 4 days a week and eat as healthy as possible. Sometimes I also try a few recipes from Tasty's and I love horror movies and am super excited for the new move The NUN.</p>
